        title: 'Shakira Shakes Snapdragon: An Unforgettable Night in San Diego!',
        date: 'June 27, 2025',
        content: `Leaving Rancho Penasquitos at 7:30 PM, it was a long-awaited moment. I was counting the day. It's been a while since I bought a ticket. Shakira for me is an icon of humanity, a divine success, an empathy, a sport, human civilization and a unity in the polarized world. It's more than dance and songs!
The air, still carrying the faint chill of a receding night, hummed with anticipation as the clock nudged 7:30 PM. Leaving the familiar, tree-lined streets of Rancho Peñasquitos, it wasn't just another Friday evening to commute south. This was a moment long awaited, a threshold we were finally crossing, promising an adventure that stretched beyond the horizon and into the wild embrace of the unknown of euphoria.
Attending so many games and events in Snapdragon stadium, I knew about the traffic of San Diego, driving south in 163 and taking the exit of east friars road. Never ever use the 15, if you are going to the Snapdragon for events. I've been to Snapdragon Stadium a lot, I know the San Diego traffic pretty well, You should definitely avoid I-15 when going to events at Snapdragon Stadium.
Wow. Just, wow. My ears are still ringing (in the best way possible!) and I'm still buzzing from the incredible Shakira concert last night at Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego. What a show!
Shakira truly brought her A-game for the "Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran" World Tour. The energy in the stadium was absolutely electric from the moment she stepped on stage. I mean, from the first beat, everyone was on their feet, singing along to every word and dancing. The beautiful steps of the Latin dance and song reverberate not only with Latin fans but equally with me although I don’t understand the Beauty of Spanish languages.
The stage production was phenomenal in three contexts - the voice of Shakira, the dance and the stage environments. The environment and stage are the juxtaposition of light, sounds, 3D animation and display. I certainly believe that AI has been used, her voice was just as powerful and captivating live as it is on her albums. And those hips? They definitely don't lie! It was amazing to see her iconic moves in person. I learned how to shake the hips!
We were in Section A1, Row 27, Seat 24 (and Row 28, Seat 24), and the view was fantastic. When she started in the beginning, Shakira was merely 10 ft away from me. Being able to experience that kind of proximity with thousands of other fans was truly something special.
And then started……... .Waka Waka and San Diego FC in the top of the MLS western conference was a blast for me and the fans. And whenever wherever……the fun continues, and you sweat like hell, but you never stop.
Many of the dance moves are rooted deep into the Latin dances and it was so good to experience that. However, some of the bits were very identical to the one done by Nepathya - Nepali legend band and also something related to the local music of Kathmandu valley and Shiva’s Tandav dance. It might be a coincidence, but I feel the mix of all eastern and western music and dances.
If you ever get the chance to see Shakira live, do it! You won't regret it. What a night to remember! I will definitely go again if she is back.`,

"Oh, the sheer variety of Kilimanjaro's terrain! It's like stepping through different worlds on a single mountain. You begin in the warmth of an equatorial setting at the base, where life bustles, but as you climb, the journey takes you into a completely different realm – the stark, icy conditions of an Arctic summit. Imagine that! Five distinct zones greet you: the welcoming Lower Slopes, lush and vibrant; the misty, mysterious Rainforest, where the air is thick with humidity; the Moorland, with its dramatic shift from sun-baked days to chilling nights; the rugged Alpine Forest, all rock and scree; and then, the final, awe-inspiring Arctic zone, where the cold bites deep and the wind whispers secrets of the summit.  It's a truly remarkable place where nature shows off its incredible diversity. My own adventure began with a series of long flights. Leaving sunny San Diego for a quick hop to Minneapolis, I was then off on an overnight journey to Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. The weather in Minneapolis threw a wrench in things, delaying our Amsterdam flight, but it gave me an unexpected glimpse into Dutch life—and yes, they are incredibly tall! That airport had a certain charm, a sense of history, even if the technology was a bit more updated than its aesthetic. Finally, another long haul took me to Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. It was a whirlwind of travel, each leg adding to the anticipation of the mountain ahead."
After lunch, it was  about four hour drive from Arusha that took us to the Lemosho Gate (7,550 ft / 2,300m), located on the western side of Kilimanjaro.
We arrived by midday, registered at the gate and entered Kilimanjaro Park, and we will have our lunch at the gate and we will begin to realize that we are on one of the least trodden routes compared to the "standard" lines of ascent such as Machame and Marangu.
The flora and fauna are richer here and in places the vegetation is so untouched that it grows right across the narrow track In approximately three hours, we reached camp in the forest at Mti Mkubwa, otherwise known as Big Tree Camp, at 9,186 ft / 2,800m.
D+3( December 30)
Oh, my goodness, that first night on the mountain, December 30th, 2024, was something else! Trying to fall asleep was quite the experience. It wasn’t just the newness of being in a tent, which was surprisingly comfortable and sturdy, by the way—and the restrooms were great, too!—it was the sounds. All night long, I could hear the roars of monkeys. Not just any monkeys, either. These were beautiful black and white ones, and their calls echoed through the night. It was a little unnerving at first, not being used to those sounds, but also kind of magical. It felt like I was truly immersed in the wild, surrounded by this incredible world I’d only ever read about. Definitely an ‘interesting’ night, in the best possible way.
The Crater rim has been massively eroded over time by weather and volcanic action. Today we'll get our first close views of Kibo - the central volcanic cone and literally "the Roof of Africa". The second of the 3 volcanic spouts that make up Kilimanjaro is Mawenzi, but this lies hidden for the time being to the east of Kibo.
The walk was approximately 6 hours before reaching the camp at 11,480 ft / 3,500m. This is the place where merging happens from other routes for Kilimanjaro. We ate pop-corn and drink tea. It was delicious!
D+4 ( December 31)
That night was rough. I just couldn't seem to get any real sleep, and I woke up feeling utterly exhausted. But then, something magical happened. I opened my eyes, and there it was: Kilimanjaro. The first time I truly saw it. And it was…different. Really different from what I expected. You see, I grew up in the Himalayas, surrounded by these massive ranges, stacks of mountains piled one behind another. But Kilimanjaro? It just stood there, solitary and immense, the tallest freestanding mountain in the world. It had this quiet, powerful presence. I remember just staring, completely mesmerized, realizing that this wasn't just another mountain; it was something truly special, something unique and awe-inspiring.`,

Today marks the beginning of our adventure. Onion Valley, situated approximately 15 miles west of downtown Independence, stands at an impressive elevation of about 9,600 feet. The access road to this scenic location is typically open from May to November, contingent on snow conditions.
We arrived at the Onion Valley campground in the afternoon, following a six-hour drive northeast from San Diego. The journey was long but filled with anticipation. This campground lies to the west of Death Valley National Park, which, at 282 feet below sea level, holds the record for the lowest point in North America.
Despite not sleeping well, I woke up early and had breakfast. The bread and scrambled eggs were ready, but I didn’t eat the bread. We then began our hike towards Kearsarge Pass.`,

        content: `It was a beautiful evening in the month of June 2006, when I was nominated for a 10-month professional computing course in China. Obviously, I was wondering and dreaming about China – One of the modern but unexplored world and hidden society. Even though, this was not first Journey in Life but travelling abroad has been my fantasy from the time I was a kid. As we left Kathmandu in morning, it took couple of hours when Aircraft started to decrease its altitude and was near to the vicinity of the Hong Kong Airport. The sparkling view I could peep from the window of airplane was spectacular. The Hong Kong Airport is wonderful and very beautiful, an airport surrounded by the sea. The glistening and gleaming rays on the horizon were more alluring as it flashes through tributaries of my mind. I was also experiencing one of the most sophisticated and high-tech airports in this part of the world.`,

        title: 'Sky Diving in San Diego, California',
        date: 'December 26, 2021',
        content: `It was the decision that I took at the end of the year, December of 2021. I had always wanted skydiving after seeing cool Hollywood television series every Sunday in Nepal Television when I was growing up, back in Himalayas, Nepal. I searched google, did some basic research on safety and figured out that it's 0.003 casualties per 1000 jumps in ten years, that's nearer and dearer to me than anything else. It's less than 1 in 107 dying in a car crash and 1 in 289 in gun assault in the United States.
I was quite surprised but not shocked to find the cost of a complimentary product - video/photos are literally equal to the cost of jumping, I know we live in Instagram world and I do not use facebook and Instagram. I made up my mind and within a minute, I bought a package for $393. Half of the cost is video and pictures. It's a lifetime experience, I am determined. I checked the weather and Saturday looks sunny with 65 as highest. Now the clock starts to tick and I was just waiting for the Saturday noon.
I was a little worried about what clothes I should wear although the site has a good FAQ and everything about sky diving. I went to REI and bought a blue t-shirt and altrahike shoes. It was just a coincidence to buy those gears that I had needed for some time.
It was a 30 minutes drive south from the place where I live. I reached the place at 11:40 at 13531 Otay Lakes Rd, Jamul, CA 91935. Everything was self directed. Although the guy at reception forgot to give me the T-shirt, I got the T-shirt in my mail after a couple of weeks. It is a nice T-Shirt.
The first thing I needed to fill was waiving hundreds of pages of liabilities. I was quite uncomfortable signing the pages many times and each page request for waiver of liabilities. Every time I read it, "we don't cover this, we are not liable for this." It was really scary - believe me, that part was more scary than jumping from the plane in 13,000 ft. altitude.
After that they gave me the badge for photography. I looked at the trainers' pictures - there were 12 of them and I realized that every 20 minutes the plane flies whether it has 2 passengers or 20 passengers at the maximum.
They gave me basic training about safety. Later, I met my instructor, Chris - a middle aged man who does this for fun and has been doing the same in the Army. I didn't stop short of saying, I used to work in Nepalese Army for 9 years, The bond becomes even closer. He walked me through what's going to happen. I was even more confident.
As we started to move towards the plan for the flight, it was even more exciting. We were marching like the soldiers. The plane has long horizontal seats on two sides where two individuals can sit, the door looks pretty rudimentary.
Everybody was instructed to put on the seat belt, there was only one pilot driving and cock-pit was pretty open, the other side of the pilot seat was empty.
My instructor and I were sitting face to face and he showed me the beautiful parts of Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, California. It also had a majestic view showing the pacific ocean in the rim. The plan was hitting 50-60% in grade, the sky was blue and clean and we are waiting for 13,000 ft. in altitude. Chris asked me to sit in his lap and he fixed all the clips. It was quite an experience being dependent on someone for your life. But honestly, you are doing the same when you are flying in the airplane or somebody is giving you a ride in motorbike.
There was a couple behind me, she looked very stressed and nervous. She asked me "Have you done this before", I said to her, "No, first time", She said you look very calm, I said I am really excited. Her face looked nervous and she was nervous. I keep on making things calm and easy and keep on exciting them. We were only three for tandem jump.
Then in front of my eyes, they opened the door which is in the back side of the plane. The solo jumper started to jump in the air like a spider man - quite amazing, huh? I feel like I was watching a spider man or matrix - resurrection (actually this weekend I watched both of those movies in theater, I found Dr. strange in spider man and wondering you will take me to the amazing land of Himalayas, Nepal).
I realized that our time is coming and Chris told me that I have to lean towards him when we are falling and jumping. Also, I was instructed to put my legs close together and lean my feet up towards the sky. I didn't know why but it's all about gravity in the free fall and I was not sure if I could do that right or not. As we reached the door of the airplane, I believe I did right. When I saw the pictures and video later, I found I was doing a back-flip at 13,000 ft. altitude. How exciting is that? It's truly more beautiful than the matrix - resurrection. I love you Keanu Reeves! and Trinity.
It was really really fast for the first 15 seconds but it was the moment I was looking for. Every second counts as you fall down and you feel like you are in the phantom of space where nothing really exist and your mind doesn't have time to think anything else, forget about your body or existence. I really enjoyed it, it was too short, it was like being more than in the metaverse, the real metaverse, not the digital fantasy that you created in the computer programs.
I really enjoyed that part of the fall and certainly I was in the sky looking downwards and my cameraman was in front of me. For a long time he was asking me to see the camera but I didn't realize, I keep on seeing his eyes. I just came out of the metaverse, how could I realize the reality. Finally I realized I had to see a camera, so I did it. After a few minutes I had a pressure in my shoulder and certainly the parachute opened, after that it was simply an easy and relaxing flight as you watch the beautiful terrain of southern California and lower your altitude. The parachute swings to and fro and falls down gently towards the ground.
Chris told me to put my legs a little up when we were landing, we landed perfectly. It was amazing, it was a great experience, it was something you should think about, it was a life changing experience and yes, I am going to do it again!!.
I thanked Chris and my photographer for being so close to my life. I am done, that's all about my sky diving 101? What do you think? I expect to do the second one in the Himalayas, Nepal near Everest at least from 20,000 ft from sea level.`,
