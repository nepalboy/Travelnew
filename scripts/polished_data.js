I was amazed to see the sun still up at 9 PM—I've never seen such late sunsets! Mendoza is beautiful with its lush greenery and massive, strong old trees. The people here dress elegantly, often in white to stay cool. I even saw my favorite bird, the pigeon, which makes me feel right at home as it reminds me of Kathmandu, Nepal, where I was born and raised.\n\nThe weather is fascinating—a mix of cool winds in the shade and warm sunshine. Later in the day, I met my friend Ian and his two sons, whom I first met during my Kilimanjaro climb. They're joining the same Aconcagua expedition, which will be fun! Ending the day watching a movie about an Everest climber who summited 21 times. It was a very emotional and heart-touching story about the mountain people and the reality of poverty that still exists in our world. It's a reminder of where I come from. A good day for reflection.",

We had an amazing lunch along the way. Tonight we're staying in a dormitory-style room with nine other people—a true high school-style dormitory experience! We've finally reached an altitude of 8,800 feet. It's windy but stunningly beautiful out here. Looking forward to hitting the trail tomorrow.",

Once the fun began, we found the trail to be rocky, winding along a small river between towering mountains. There aren't many trees, but the wildflowers (white and purple) are beautiful. The most fascinating sight is the mules carrying all the expedition loads between camps. It reminded me so much of the yaks in the Everest region. \n\nWe had a nice lunch of cheese sandwiches by the river and I spotted some swallows—a bird I've loved since childhood. By 5 PM, we arrived at our first base camp, Pampa de las Leñas, at 2,950 meters. The weather is decent, not too cold. Feeling excited for what's next!",

Today is slated to be our longest day, roughly 16-17 km and about 6+ hours of hiking to reach the second camp. During lunch, I had the biggest apple I've ever eaten! The valley is massive and stunning. I saw an animal from the camel family—I'll have to look up exactly what it was (likely a Guanaco). We also saw horses and many colorful birds, like a sparrow with an orange-ish neck. By evening, we were nearing the camp with a view of Aconcagua appearing for the first time. It looks amazing. Happy New Year to everyone!",
